      <p>
        1. Roll the numbered dice to generate a number,
        <br> the number you roll is the number to look out for during the walk.
        <br> There's something special about that number.
        <br>
        <br> 2. Pick any two dice and roll them
        <br> to determine which direction to walk
        <br> or what to do if it involves the word dice.
        <br>
        <br> you may ask the 8 ball if you should roll both
        <br> numbered dice for example
        <br>
        <br> 3. Example: if there are 3 directions to go
        <br> rolling both numbered dice generates the number '8'.
        <br> direction 1 would be any number between 1-4
        <br> direction 2 would be 5-8 and
        <br> direction 3 direction would be 9-12.
        <br> or if the word dice says
        <br> 'follow the white rabbit'
        <br> and the other dice says '3' then you follow the white rabbit
        <br> for 3 minutes, try not to make it obvious or get caught.
        <br>
        <br> Always be cautious and respectful
